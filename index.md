## The beginning

On June 3rd I received a new SIM to move to an O2 rolling plan as I wanted more data than my current, years-old O2 monthly plan. Porting my original number over to that new plan didn't work. To address that, I was encouraged to switch to an un-publicised, discounted pay-monthly tarif, which I accepted.

More than <b>8</b> weeks later, I <i>still</i> do not have working service.

This is despite:

 * Many calls to the helpline, totalling over 5 hours including multiple unfulfilled promises of callbacks.
 
 * An email to the CEO - unanswered
 
 * A signed-for letter to the CEO - unacknowledged
 
 * Opening an official complaint, which will be 8 weeks old on 15th August, at which point at Ofcom and the [Telecoms Ombudsman](https://www.commsombudsman.org) get involved.
 
 * Multiple "resolved" tickets, none of which has made any perceptible difference.
 
<B>NOTE</B>:<br/>
Everybody I have directly dealt with throughout this process has been polite, understanding and helpful - I have no complaint with them. However, that does not mean this process hasn't been <b><i>incredibly</i></b> frustrating. Porting a number between providers is supposed to take less than 24 hours. Switching tariffs with the same provider has taken 8 weeks (and counting). The problem seems to be that the mechanisms and processes of the inner workings of O2 serve as a barrier to resolution, rather than an enabler. 

## Current status

### Making calls
I can make a call from my phone, and the receiver sees it as originating from my number.

### Receiving calls
Attempts to call my number, for example from a landline result in the audio message:

 > "The number you have dialed has not been recognised"

### Sending and receiving SMS messages
Neither works. In a world where so many online services (e.g. your bank) use SMS for two-factor authentication, this is problematic.

Facetime and iMessage also both require SMS to authenticate a device, so I am not contactable via those services on my number.

### Mobile data
Works fine

### Tickets raised
4 that I know of. None have made a detectable difference.

## The history

### June

#### Monday 3rd
Rolling plan SIM activated

#### Tuesday 4th
Activation "completed", but phone still thinks it has the temporary number. Called support, promised a resolution within 24 hours.

#### Wednesday 5th
Still not working. Phoned support, persuaded back on to a (discounted) monthly tarif as the best path to resolution.

#### Thursday 6th
Pay-monthly SIM activation call - told to expect it to go live within 24 hours.

#### Friday 7th
Received an "order confirmation" SMS. My phone can make and receive calls, but doesn't know its own number so can't iMessage or FaceTime.

#### Saturday 8th, Sunday 9th
Tried all the recommended solutions - manually enter number, reset network settings, reboot phone, remove + replace SIM. Wait patiently without changing anything. No change.

#### Monday 10th
Another helpdesk call to report current status. No progress.

#### Tuesday 11th
42 minute call in which I immediately requested to speak to a supervisor, which was politely refused and deflected. A tech support ticket was raised and an update promised for the next day or Saturday.

#### Wednesday 12th
No callback

#### Saturday 15th
Still no callback

#### Monday 17th
Another helpdesk call, this time to be told that the previous ticket had been raised incorrectly and would take 10 days to process. A "back office" ticket was raised in its place, with a 4..24 hour promise.

#### Tuesday 18th
A confusing combination of events:
 * an SMS announcing that my number has been ported
 * a callback from yesterday's helpdesk telling me the number has been disconnected (I think they were accidentally referring to the SIM's original number?) and another callback was promised.
 
#### Wednesday 19th
No callback.
There's 3 ways of querying your balance:

 * Send an SMS to a particular number
 * Use the O2 app
 * Use your account on the O2 website
 
All 3 were giving me very different output, so I called the helpdesk to see about getting that untangled. After explaining the situation to him, and without any comment, the operative put me on hold. Eventually he returned, promising a fix within 24 hours.

That would be the last time I was able to send or receive a text (or for that matter, login to my O2 account, because it requires SMS authentication).

#### Thursday 20th
Found the complaints email address ([complaintreviewservice@o2.com](mailto:complaintreviewservice@o2.com)) and sent the team there a message explaining my dissatisfaction. Quickly received automated reply, claiming I should see a response within 7 days. (As of July 31st, this is now at 41 days, without response)

#### Saturday 22nd
Asked via Twitter to speak to somebody in the UK, but told the only option was the helpline.

#### Monday 24th
Another helpline call, totalling 54 minutes. Queries regarding the previously opened tickets were confusing, claiming the ticket wasn't opened until the 20th (was actually the 17th)

#### Tuesday 25th, Thursday 27th
Interactions over Twitter, containing assurances that the urgency of fixing this was being conveyed on tickets.

#### Friday 28th
Sent an email to the CEO ([lutz.schueler@virginmedia.co.uk](mailto:lutz.schueler@virginmedia.co.uk)) - no response to date.

Found some useful wording on the Ofcom website, albeit describing the process of moving a number between providers:

 > If the switch takes more than one working day or there is an abuse of the process by your provider, you are entitled to reasonable compensation from your provider. Providers must inform customers how to access this compensation and how it will be paid.

### July

#### Monday 1st
Called [Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/make-a-complaint/complain-about-mobile-phone-or-internet-services/) for advice, and was told about the 8 week rule and the process of requesting a "dead-lock letter" and referring the issue to the [telecoms ombudsman](https://www.commsombudsman.org). I was also encouraged to contact the complaints address again, mentioning "ofcom".

#### Wednesday 3rd
Sent the CEO a signed-for letter, requesting my problem be given more attention. (Thanks to [ceoemail.com](https://www.ceoemail.com/s.php?id=ceo-9614&c=O2-Chief%20Executive) for providing the details)

#### Thursday 4th
Letter delivered (as of July 31st, still nothing to suggest it had any effect)
Another email to the complaints address, mentioning "ofcom" and "ombudsman", but it had no discernable effect.

#### Friday 5th
Discovered the ["Resolver"](https://www.resolver.co.uk) service and used it to register a complaint, but was disappointed to find it seems to be nothing more than a web interface to the email address I'd already used.

<p style="font-family: monospace">&lt; No updates as I was away for a while &gt;</p>

<B>NOTE</B>:<br/>
From this point onwards all interactions have been via Twitter (generally DMs), unless otherwise stated.


#### Monday 22nd

Enquired about progress.

#### Tuesday 23rd
Had to explain the whole situation from scratch, again.

#### Wednesday 24th
Another ticket has been created and a promise made that I will be updated.

#### Tuesday 30th
Almost another week has gone by - surely progress has been made?
Two prongs of attack today:
 * I emailed the complaints service again, pointing out that I do not consider the complaint resolved and that it has been 40 days with no contact.
 * Enquired about the progress of last Wednesday's ticket only to be told it has been closed. Another new ticket is opened and escalated.
 
#### Wednesday 31st
For the first time I am provided with an update without having to ask for it. Sadly that update is disappointing in two ways:

 * It is announcing that the ticket has been resolved (and yet still my phone is unusable)
 * It is actually referring to the Wednesday 24th ticket, which we already know is closed.
 
*Another* new ticket is raised, along with assurances that *this* ticket is with the right team.

### August

#### Monday 5th
Enquired as to the progress of the latest ticket, noting that I have not yet been called.
